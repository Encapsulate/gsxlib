About
=====

GsxLib is a PHP library that simplifies communication with Apple's [GSX web service API][1]. It frees the application developer
from knowing the underlying PHP SOAP architecture and to some extent even the GSX API itself. GsxLib also tries to provide
some performance benefits by minimizing the number of requests made to the servers as well as doing some rudimentary input
validation (as opposed to burdening Apple's servers with totally invalid requests).

Requrements
===========

- SOAP support in your PHP.
- GSX account with the "Can access Web Services" privilege enabled

Usage
=====

Best illustrated with a simple example:

    <?php
  
      include 'gsxlib/gsxlib.php';
      $gsx = GsxLib::getInstance($sold_to, $username, $password);
      $info = $gsx->warrantyStatus($serialnumber);
      echo $info->productDescription;
      > MacBook Pro (15-inch 2.4/2.2GHz)
      
    ?>

If you're in the US, remember to set the fifth argument to the constructor to 'am'.

gsxcl
=====

The package includes a rudimentary command line client to the GSX API called _gsxcl_. It can perform various functions in the library and is meant
mainly as a simple test tool for the library.
